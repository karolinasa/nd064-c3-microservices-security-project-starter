1. Incident commander name:
Crypto-mining containers (minergate, moneropool, xmrpooldotnet) were launched affecting CPU usage.
2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three different crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, xmrpooldotnet) were launched.
They used CPU resources until being destroyed 20 minutes after their launch.
Suspicious activity was noticed in Grafana through Falco logs.
3. Summary of what was affected:
CPU usage was affected. The usage increased by 30% after crypto miners launch.
4. Summary of the impact:
The attacker was able to access the cluster and launch containers that used CPU resources.
5. Summary of the remediation steps:
After noticing a significant jump in CPU usage the exact cause was detected through Falco in
Grafana monitoring dashboard.
Crypto-mining pods were destroyed.
The following remediation steps being taken are increasing security of the cluster.
6. Summary of lessons learned:
Using unidentified images should not be allowed in the system. Access to the cluster and config files
should be adjusted.

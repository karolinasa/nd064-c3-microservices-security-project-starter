# TODO: remove hardening steps taken
Rancher RKE Baseline was implemented to harden the RKE cluster.
That includes:
1) Creating etcd user and group
2) Ensuring that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd
3) Configuring Kernel Runtime parameters
4) Updating cluster.yml file with hardening steps

# TODO: 200 words
1) How you will test the changes?
The changes will be tested using a test cluster.
2) How you will ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
The changes will be tested using a test cluster not touching the production environment.
After applying changes Prometheus and Grafana will be used to monitor metrics.
